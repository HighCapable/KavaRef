# Introduce

> `KavaRef` is a modern Java reflection API implemented using Kotlin.

## Background

This is a modern Java reflection API implemented using Kotlin, designed to provide a cleaner and easier-to-use API while retaining the power of Java
reflection.

The project icon is designed by [MaiTungTM](https://github.com/Lagrio) and is named from **K**otlinJ**avaRef**lection, meaning Java reflection
implemented using Kotlin.

It was firstborn in the [YukiHookAPI](https://github.com/HighCapable/YukiHookAPI), and was later decoupled into
the [YukiReflection](https://github.com/HighCapable/YukiReflection) project.

As you can see, now `KavaRef` is a completely new set of APIs completely refactored with the design idea of â€‹`YukiReflection`,
which has no affiliation and will replace `YukiReflection` as a new reflection solution.

If you are using `YukiReflection` or the `YukiHookAPI` project related to it, you can refer to [here](../config/migration) to migrate the reflection API to `KavaRef`.

## Usage

`KavaRef` is built in Kotlin **lambda** syntax with Java Builder style.

It can replace [Java's native Reflection API](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javareflection.html) and implement a more complete reflection solution in a more human-friendly language.

## Skill Requirements

You must be proficient in Java's native reflection APIs, understand Java's class loading mechanisms, bytecode structures, and how they are used in Kotlin (if you are using Kotlin).

## Language Requirement

It is recommended to use Kotlin. API code composition also supports Java,
but in pure Java projects `KavaRef` may not be able to play its full functionality and syntactic sugar advantages.

All the demo sample code in the documentation will be described first using Kotlin.
If you don't know how to use Kotlin at all, you may not be able to experience and use the functionality of `KavaRef` more fully.
