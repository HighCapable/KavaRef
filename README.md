## What's this

This is a modern Java reflection API implemented using Kotlin, designed to provide a cleaner and easier-to-use API while retaining the power of Java
reflection.

The project icon is designed by [MaiTungTM](https://github.com/Lagrio) and is named from **K**otlinJ**avaRef**lection, meaning Java reflection
implemented using Kotlin.

It was firstborn in the [YukiHookAPI](https://github.com/HighCapable/YukiHookAPI), and was later decoupled into
the [YukiReflection](https://github.com/HighCapable/YukiReflection) project.

As you can see, now `KavaRef` is a completely new set of APIs completely refactored with the design idea of `YukiReflection`,
which has no affiliation and will replace `YukiReflection` as a new reflection solution.
